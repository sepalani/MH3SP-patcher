# ISO Patcher

**Only use this patcher if you are going to use an USB loader!**
**Otherwise, use the Riivolution patcher instead for Dolphin and disc users!**

## Disclaimer
This project is based on Wiimmfi Patcher and Wiimms ISO Tools. Unless you're
using the released packages we provide, you'll need to download the
Wiimmfi ISO Patcher and replace their patcher script with our own.

## How-to
Move the entire content of the `iso-patcher` folder into the Wiimmfi Patcher
directory. It **must** replace both `patch-images.sh` and `bin/setup.sh`
files.

To run the patcher, follow the instructions as described in the
**Download and patching** section from the Wiimmfi Patcher website. The MH3SP
patched game will be located in the `mh3sp-images` folder.
